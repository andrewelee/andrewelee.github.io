        <div class="info">
          <p>M.Duck is a game about a duck who knows magic fighting his way up a mysterious tower.</p>
          <p>It is a lighthearted roguelite shooting gallery game inspired by games such as Wild Guns and Enter the Gungeon. Players will have to aim and shoot at enemies while dodging various incoming attacks to keep Magic Duck safe. It takes a lot of focus for Magic Duck to battle so he can’t move while aiming or casting spells. As the player makes their way up the tower, they will face randomized waves of enemies and bosses while acquiring different items to improve Magic Duck's chances of survival.</p>
          <p>The game contains over 40 enemies, 8 unique bosses, and over 60 relics. Magic Duck also has access to field notes which contain information on enemies/relics, measure the player’s progression, and include various challenges which can be completed to unlock lore and new relics.</p>
